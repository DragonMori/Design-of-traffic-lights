# Design-of-traffic-lights
随着社会的发展和进步以及人民生活水平的提高，上路的车辆越来越多，但相应的公路设施却没有相应的改善,这就导致了城市交通拥堵问题突出，而且拥堵的地方多是十字路口等车辆汇集处。
如何改善交通灯控制系统，以适应现在的交通状况，成为竞相研究的课题，本文对该问题给予了深刻地研究。
本文实现基于PLC的交通信号的按时段自动控制系统，主要用于处理十字路口车辆及行人通过的问题,使其减少相互干扰，提高了十字路口的通行能力。
根据当前时间来决定信号灯的运行状态，用PLC实现单个十字路口交通信号灯控制的方法，以单个十字路口四个相位交通灯为例，把PLC作为一个控制器，采用梯形图编程实现自动控制。
通过实验，我们保证了系统运行稳定可靠，同时能根据不同的交通流量进行手动控制决策，从而可以有效的解决交通流量不均衡、不稳定带来的问题。<br><br>
The course design scheme with the title of "design of PLC control systemfor
traffiWith the development and progress of society and the improvement of people's
living standards, there are more and more vehicles on the road, but the correspondingroad facilities have not been improved, which leads to the prominent problemof
urban traffic congestion, and the congested places are mostly intersections and other
vehicle collection places. How to improve the traffic light control systemto adapt tothe current traffic conditions has become a competitive research topic. This paper
gives a deep research on this problem. <br>
In this paper, the traffic signal automatic control system based on PLCis realized, 
which is mainly used to deal with the problem of vehicles and pedestrians passingthrough the intersection, 
so as to reduce the mutual interference and improve thetraffic capacity of the intersection. 
According to the current time to determine therunning state of the signal lamp, 
the method of using PLC to realize the control of thetraffic signal lamp at a single intersection. 
Taking the four phase traffic lights at asingle intersection as an example, the PLC is used as a controller, and the ladder
diagram programming is used to realize the automatic control. Through experiments, we ensure that the system is stable and reliable, and can make manual control
decisions according to different traffic flows, so as to effectively solve the problems
caused by uneven and unstable traffic flows.
